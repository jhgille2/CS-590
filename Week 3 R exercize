# Create two vectors (A and B), where A is (1,2,3) and B is (4,5,6). With these vectors, use the cbind() or rbind() function to create a 2 x 3 matrix from the vectors. Based on the output, determine the appropriate function to use
A <- c(1,2,3)
B <- c(4,5,6)

rbind(A, B)

# Create a 3 x 3 matrix consisting of the numbers 1-9. Create this matrix using the shortcut 1:9 and by specifying the nrow argument in the matrix() function call. Assign this matrix to the variable *ma
mat <- matrix(c(1:9), nrow = 3)
mat

# Confirm that mat is a matrix
is.matrix(mat)

# Create a 5 x 5 matrix consisting of the numbers 1-25 and assign it to the variable mat2. The top row should be the numbers 1-5
mat2 <- matrix(1:25, byrow = TRUE, nrow = 5)
mat2

# Use index notation to grab a subsection of mat2 that replicates the output
mat2[2:3, 2:3]

# Use index notation to grab a subsection of mat2 that replicates the output
mat2[4:5, 4:5]

# What is the sum of all of the elements of mat2?
