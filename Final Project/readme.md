## Final Project Overview
### Methods for detecting and Modeling spatial correlation in Field Trials

#### Overview
I think it woluld be interesting and worthwile to explore some of the functionaliaty offered by R for handling spatial correlation structures in datasets. My hope is to focus in specifically on the variation that could arise in field experiments, but I anticipate that I will be drawing heavily from methods used to analyse ecological data both because that is where most of my familiarity of the subject comes from, but also because it genuinely seems to be the area with the most active ongoing development of these models in R. 

My end goal will be to both explore the models used to account for this spatial variation, and the methods used to visualize these models.
