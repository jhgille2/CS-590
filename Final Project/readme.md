# Exploring GWAS data from the soybean NAM population

This directory is where I put the data, and workflow for creating some visualizations of GWAS data I made from the soybean NAM poulation. The main presentation is in the jupyter notebook above, but I've also included the raw datasets I used in the overview in the "Data" folder. Additionally, I've added the script I used to run the GWAS with the NAM package in the Data folder as it hasn't been rendering properly in the jupyter notebook. 

I've also included some articles/pages which may be helpful in the "Literature" folder.
