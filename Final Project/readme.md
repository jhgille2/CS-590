# Exploring GWAS data from the soybean NAM population

This directory is where I put the data, and workflow for creating some visualizations of GWAS data I made from the soybean NAM poulation. The main presentation is in the jupyter notebook above, but I've also included the raw datasets I used in the overview in the "Data" folder.

I've also included some articles/pages which may be helpful in the "Lterature" folder.
